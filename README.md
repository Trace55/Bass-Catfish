# Bass-Catfish
A Predator-Prey Model for Largemouth Basss and Channel Catfish
  
Abstract: Largemouth bass and Channel catfish are considered highly common freshwater sport fish. They are highly-populated and can be found in almost any lake in Texas. However, they tend to be overfished and must be restocked in order to attract anglers. The goal of this project was to create a model to analyze the predator-prey relationship between these two types of fish and determine how best to find populations at healthy levels. By finding the conditions for healthy levels of co-existence for each fish, pond and lake owners are able to make better decisions about restocking. The data used has been taken from several sources and uses averages from the studies to fit to the differential equation model. With this data, equilibria are found and analyzed to determine parameter ranges where co-existence is possible. With the information from the basic model, a more advanced model can be made that will account for water level/quality and look at higher volumes of these populations and the issues of overfeeding these fish.
